## SmartMirror

### Introduction
Welcome to my first Embedded Linux project - the SmartMirror.

My goal in building this project to learn more about Embedded Linux using the Yocto distribution.

### Why Embedded Linux? Why Yocto?
Embedded Linux is becoming more pervasive in Embedded System solutions due to a variety of factors:
* Stable, High-Performance
* Scalable
* Access to applications and networking protocols
* Ubiquitous
* "Free"

The Yocto Project is becoming a prominent solution for Embedded Linux because:
* Its incredibly customizable.
* No need for big, laborious tool-chains.
* Frees the devs to worry about developing.

However, the learning curve is incredibly steep.

### What Hardware Will I Be Using?
1. RaspberryPi4B (target board)
2. Acer Predator Laptop with Windows 10 with Ubuntu Virtual Machine
3. Arduino UNO (for Serial debugging)

### What Software Will I Be Using?
1. C++
2. Scripting Languages - Bash (Yocto setup), Batch/Powershell (VM setup)
3. Python *potentially depending on implementation*

### Why Raspberry Pi?
Alright, yes I'm using the RPi. 

This was a dev board I already had laying around that was Yocto compatible and it has all of the hardware needed to support the project.

### What You'll Find Here
1. My design and development approach.
2. Documentation of my tools, development environments, etc.
3. Documentation of the system, hardware, and software components.
4. *Hopefully* a finished SmartMirror.
